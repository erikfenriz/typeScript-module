# Overview

These TypeScript programs show fundamental programming concepts by applying central features such as console output, 
recursion, classes, lists, and async functions. 
It further includes error handling to show the management of errors. 
The app executes a variety of distinct tasks that highlight these features so the full functionality 
of TypeScript is exhibited.

The primary focus of this program is to provide a systematic and practical introduction to TypeScript's 
programming concepts. It serves as tutorial support to master recursion, programming with classes, 
dealing with lists, and asynchronous computations. 
It also imparts lessons on the importance of error control in good design of software.
